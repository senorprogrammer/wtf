  <span style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 1.6em;">WTF</span> is a personal information dashboard for your
  terminal, developed for those who spend most of their day in the command line.
  </p>

  <p>
  It provides a framework for rapidly viewing important at-a-glance information easily.
  </p>

  <p>
  Keep an eye on your <strong>OpsGenie</strong> schedules, <strong>Google Calendar</strong>, <strong>Git</strong>
  and <strong>GitHub</strong> repositories, and <strong>New Relic</strong> deployments.
  </p>

  <p>
  See who's away in <strong>BambooHR</strong>, which <strong>Jira</strong> tickets are assigned to you, and what time it is in Barcelona.
  </p>

  <p>
  It even has weather. And clocks. And emoji.
