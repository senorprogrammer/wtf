<span style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 1.6em;">WTF</span> is a personal information dashboard for your terminal, developed for those who spend most of their day in the command line.

It allows you to monitor services and systems that you otherwise might
keep browser tabs open for, the kinds of things you don't always need
visible, but might check in on every now and then.

## Quick Start

1. <a href="https://github.com/andrewzolotukhin/wtf/releases">Download</a> the stand-alone, compiled binary.
2. Unzip the downloaded file.
3. From the command line, `cd` into the newly-created `/wtf` directory.
4. From the command line, run the app: `./wtf`

This should launch the app in your terminal using the default simple
configuration. See <a href="/posts/configuration/">Configuration</a> for
more details.

## Command-line Options

`--config, -c` <br />
Allows you to define a custom config file to use. See <a href="/posts/configuration/">Configuration</a> for more details.

`--help, -h` <br />
Shows help information for the command-line arguments that WTF
takes.

`--module, -m` <br />
Shows help information for the specific named module, if that module
supports help text. <br />
Example: `wtf --module=todo`.

`--version, -v` <br />
Shows version info.
